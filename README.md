As an Information Systems graduate with a strong background in software development, I am passionate about the role of technology in transforming businesses and lives. I have worked on a variety of projects for clients in different industries during my previous role as a front-end developer and UI/UX designer at Folxcode Company. Recently, I have completed training in Android development and am excited to pursue a career in mobile development to continue exploring the possibilities of technology, developing my skills, and contributing to innovative mobile projects.
